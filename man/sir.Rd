\usage{
sir(
  Y,
  W = NULL,
  X = NULL,
  Z = NULL,
  family,
  method = "ALS",
  calcSE = TRUE,
  fix_receiver = FALSE,
  kron_mode = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{A three-dimensional array of dimensions (m x m x T) containing the network 
outcomes. Y[i,j,t] represents the directed outcome from node i to node j at time t.
Can contain NA values for missing observations. The diagonal (self-loops) can be 
included or excluded depending on the application.}

\item{W}{Optional three-dimensional array of dimensions (m x m x p) containing 
influence covariates used to parameterize the A and B matrices. W[i,j,r] represents
the r-th influence covariate for the edge from i to j. Common choices include:
\itemize{
  \item Graph Laplacians or adjacency matrices from other networks
  \item Geographic or social distance matrices
  \item Node-level covariates expanded to edge-level
}
If NULL or p=0, the model uses only identity matrices (no network influence structure).}

\item{X}{Optional three-dimensional array of dimensions (m x m x T) representing the 
network state that carries influence. Typically this is a lagged version of Y 
(e.g., X[,,t] = Y[,,t-1]). If NULL and W is provided, an error is thrown.
X determines which network patterns influence future outcomes.}

\item{Z}{Optional array of exogenous covariates. Can be either:
\itemize{
  \item 3D array (m x m x T): Single covariate varying across edges and time
  \item 4D array (m x m x q x T): Multiple (q) covariates
}
Examples include dyadic covariates (trade agreements, geographic distance) or
node-level attributes (GDP, population) expanded to edge-level.}

\item{family}{Character string specifying the distribution family and link function.
Must be one of "poisson", "normal", or "binomial". The choice depends on the
nature of your outcome variable.}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the estimation method. Either "ALS" 
(Alternating Least Squares) or "optim" (direct optimization via BFGS).
Default is "ALS" which is generally more stable.}

\item{calcSE}{Logical indicating whether to calculate standard errors for the
parameters. Standard errors are computed using the observed information matrix.
Setting to FALSE speeds up computation when uncertainty quantification is not needed.}

\item{fix_receiver}{Logical. If TRUE, fixes B = I (identity matrix) and
estimates only (theta, alpha). This eliminates the bilinear identification
problem (scaling ambiguity between A and B) by removing the receiver
influence channel. The model becomes a standard GLM, yielding proper
standard errors. Appropriate when receiver effects are negligible.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{kron_mode}{Logical. If TRUE, replaces separate (alpha, beta) with a
single p x p coefficient matrix C, where C[r,s] is the weight on
W_r X W_s'. This is a general fix for the bilinear identification problem.
Not yet implemented. Default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the fitting functions:
\itemize{
  \item \code{trace}: Logical or integer controlling output verbosity
  \item \code{tol}: Convergence tolerance (default 1e-6)
  \item \code{max_iter}: Maximum iterations (default 100 for ALS, 1000 for optim)
  \item \code{init_method}: Initialization method ("smart" or "random")
}}
}
\value{
An object of class "sir" containing:
  \item{A}{The m x m sender effects matrix}
  \item{B}{The m x m receiver effects matrix}
  \item{theta}{Coefficients for exogenous covariates Z}
  \item{alpha}{Coefficients for sender influence covariates W}
  \item{beta}{Coefficients for receiver influence covariates W}
  \item{summ}{Summary table with coefficients and standard errors}
  \item{ll}{Log-likelihood at convergence}
  \item{AIC}{Akaike Information Criterion}

  \item{history}{Iteration history of parameters and deviance (if trace=TRUE)}
  \item{call}{The matched call}
}
\description{
Fits a Social Influence Regression model for network data with social influence effects.
The SIR model captures how network connections influence outcomes through bilinear 
interaction terms, allowing for both sender and receiver effects in directed networks.

The model decomposes network influence into two components:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Sender effects (A matrix)}: How much influence node i exerts on others
  \item \strong{Receiver effects (B matrix)}: How susceptible node j is to influence from others
}
}
\details{
The SIR model specifies the expected outcome for the directed edge from node i to node j 
at time t as:

\deqn{\mu_{i,j,t} = \theta^T z_{i,j,t} + \sum_{k,l} X_{k,l,t} A_{i,k} B_{j,l}}

Where:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{\mu_{i,j,t}} is the expected value of the outcome Y_ijt
  \item \eqn{\theta} is a q-dimensional vector of coefficients for exogenous covariates
  \item \eqn{z_{i,j,t}} is a q-dimensional vector of exogenous covariates
  \item \eqn{X_{k,l,t}} represents the network state (often lagged Y) that carries influence
  \item \eqn{A_{i,k}} represents how node i is influenced by the behavior of node k
  \item \eqn{B_{j,l}} represents how node j's reception is affected by node l's position
}

The bilinear term \eqn{\sum_{k,l} X_{k,l,t} A_{i,k} B_{j,l}} captures network influence
and can be parameterized using influence covariates W through:
\itemize{
  \item \eqn{A = \alpha_0 I + \sum_{r=1}^{p} \alpha_r W_r} (sender effects)
  \item \eqn{B = \beta_0 I + \sum_{r=1}^{p} \beta_r W_r} (receiver effects)
}

This parameterization reduces the number of parameters from O(m²) to O(p), where p << m.

\section{Estimation Methods}{


\strong{Alternating Least Squares (ALS):}
\itemize{
  \item Iteratively optimizes A given B, then B given A
  \item Generally more stable for high-dimensional problems
  \item Better for sparse networks or when p is large
  \item May converge to local optima
}

\strong{Direct Optimization (optim):}
\itemize{
  \item Uses BFGS to optimize all parameters simultaneously
  \item Can be faster for small problems
  \item May provide better solutions when good starting values are available
  \item More prone to numerical issues in high dimensions
}
}

\section{Distribution Families}{


\strong{Poisson:} For count data (e.g., number of interactions)
\itemize{
  \item Link function: log
  \item Variance function: V(μ) = μ
  \item Use when: Y_ijt represents counts
}

\strong{Normal:} For continuous data (e.g., trade volumes, distances)
\itemize{
  \item Link function: identity
  \item Variance function: V(μ) = σ²
  \item Use when: Y_ijt is continuous and approximately normal
}

\strong{Binomial:} For binary data (e.g., presence/absence of ties)
\itemize{
  \item Link function: logit
  \item Variance function: V(μ) = μ(1-μ)
  \item Use when: Y_ijt is binary (0/1)
}
}
