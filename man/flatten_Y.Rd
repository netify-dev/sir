\title{Flatten Y Array for GLM Input}
\usage{
flatten_Y(Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Three-dimensional array (m x m x T) of network outcomes.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of length m*m*T containing flattened outcomes.
}
\description{
Converts a 3D network outcome array into a vector suitable for GLM estimation.
Uses column-major ordering (R's default) to ensure consistency with design matrices.
}
\details{
The flattening follows R's column-major convention:
\itemize{
  \item Elements are ordered: Y[1,1,1], Y[2,1,1], ..., Y[m,1,1], Y[1,2,1], ...
  \item This matches how design matrices are constructed
  \item Preserves the correspondence between outcomes and covariates
}
